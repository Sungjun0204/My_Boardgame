# My_Boardgame
---
This is my personal boardgame project as a free time. I've made handmade boardgames in several times, but I think it was difficult to play them because of their rules that I built and how to play. so I've always consider how to solve the problems, and finally chosen the solution that I use coding with Pygame in Python. 

I don't have good coding skills for making games, but I believe it isn't different from embedded coding. --(That's right, I have to google about it. absolutely isn't different from them...)-- Thanks!
